# DEMO PROJECT: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Description

A simple **Flask-based inventory management system** designed to track items, their locations, stock movements, and disposals. This is an experimental project originally developed for managing inventory in a church setting. It includes user authentication with admin controls, CSV import/export functionality, and reporting tools for managing resources across multiple locations.

## Disclaimer

* This project is intended for **educational, testing, and experimentation purposes only**.
* Approximately 97% of the code was generated by AI.
* **Not suitable for production use**.
* Use at your own risk. No warranties, guarantees, or support are provided.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Flask (Python)
* **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5
* **Database:** MySQL (or SQLite for local testing)

# Deployment Guide for PythonAnywhere (Free Plan)

This guide assumes you are starting with a fresh PythonAnywhere account.

---

## 1. Create the Web App

1. From your **PythonAnywhere Dashboard/Home Page**:
   * Navigate to **Web → Add a new web app**.
   * Select **Manual configuration**.
   * Choose **Python 3.13**.
   * This will generate your default site:

     ```
     <username>.pythonanywhere.com
     ```

---

## 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. Open a new **Bash console** from the Dashboard.
2. Create a virtual environment (it will be stored in `~/.virtualenvs/`):

```bash
mkvirtualenv myvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.13
```

> **Note:** `mkvirtualenv` is a PythonAnywhere helper command that creates a virtual environment inside `~/.virtualenvs/` and automatically configures it for use with `workon`.

The resulting path will be:
```
/home/<username>/.virtualenvs/myvirtualenv
```

---

## 3. Clone the Repository

In the Bash console, run:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/stephen-cpe/inventory_management_system.git
cd inventory_management_system
```

---

## 4. Install Dependencies

Ensure your virtual environment is active (it should be by default after creation):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 5. Initialize the Database

1. Go to the **Databases** tab and open a **MySQL console**.
2. Paste the full contents of `init_db.sql` into the console and execute.
   - This creates the initial database schema and tables.

> **Important**: This step must be completed before running Flask migrations, as it sets up the required database structure.

---

## 6. Configure Web App Settings

Go to the **Web** tab and set the following:

* **Source code:**
  ```
  /home/<username>/inventory_management_system
  ```

* **Virtualenv path:**
  ```
  /home/<username>/.virtualenvs/myvirtualenv
  ```

* **WSGI configuration file:**
  ```
  /var/www/<username>_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py
  ```

---

## 7. Edit the WSGI File

Click to edit your WSGI file and replace its contents with:

```python
import os
import sys

# Set environment variables
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'mysql+pymysql://<mysql_username>:YourSuperSecretDBPassword@<username>.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com/<mysql_username>$default'

# Add project directory to Python path
project_home = '/home/<username>/inventory_management_system'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)

# Import the Flask application
from app import app as application
```

> Replace placeholders (`<username>`, `YourSuperSecret...`) with your actual credentials.

---

## 8. Set Environment Variables (Alternative Method)

Instead of hardcoding secrets in the WSGI file, you can use PythonAnywhere's **Environment Variables** section under the **Web** tab:

* `SECRET_KEY=YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey`
* `DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://<mysql_username>:YourSuperSecretDBPassword@<username>.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com/<mysql_username>$default`

If you use this method, remove the `os.environ[...]` lines from the WSGI file.

---

## 9. Run Migrations and Create Admin User

Back in the Bash console, ensure environment variables are set for the session:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL='mysql+pymysql://<mysql_username>:YourSuperSecretDBPassword@<username>.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com/<mysql_username>$default'
export SECRET_KEY='YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey'

cd ~/inventory_management_system

flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade

# Create the admin user
flask create-admin
```

> You’ll be prompted to enter a username and password for the admin account.

---

## 10. Reload the Web App

* Go to the **Web** tab.
* Click **Reload** to apply changes.
* Visit your site:

  ```
  https://<username>.pythonanywhere.com
  ```

---

## 11. Verification Steps

1. Log in using your admin credentials (`/login`).
2. If issues occur:
   * Check the **Error log** in the Web tab.
   * Review `app.log` in the project directory (logging is handled by a `RotatingFileHandler` configured in `app.py`).
