# Local Deployment Guide for Windows 11 (MySQL)

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the application on a local Windows 11 machine using MySQL as the database.

---

## 1. Install MySQL

1.  **Download MySQL Installer:**
    *   Go to the [MySQL Downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) and download the latest MySQL Installer for Windows.
2.  **Run the Installer:**
    *   Execute the downloaded installer. Choose a "Developer Default" setup type or customize to include MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL Shell.
    *   During configuration, you will be prompted to set a root password. **Remember this password.**
    *   Ensure MySQL Server is configured to run as a Windows Service.

---

## 2. Create the Database and User

1.  **Open MySQL Command Line Client:**
    *   Search for "MySQL Command Line Client" in the Start Menu and open it.
    *   Enter the root password you set during installation.
2.  **Execute the following SQL commands** to create the database and a dedicated user for the application.

    *   Replace `YourSuperSecretDBPassword` with a secure password of your choice.

    ```sql
    -- Create the database for the inventory system
    CREATE DATABASE inventory_management_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

    -- Create a new user and grant privileges to the database
    CREATE USER 'mysql_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourSuperSecretDBPassword';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON inventory_management_db.* TO 'mysql_username'@'localhost';

    -- Apply the changes
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    -- Exit the client
    EXIT;
    ```

---

## 3. Set Up the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    *   Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and navigate to your desired project directory.
    *   Run the following command:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/stephen-cpe/inventory_management_system.git
        cd inventory_management_system
        ```
2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## 4. Initialize the Database Schema

1.  **Open MySQL Command Line Client (if closed) and select the database:**
    *   Search for "MySQL Command Line Client" in the Start Menu and open it.
    *   Enter the root password.
    *   Type:
        ```sql
        USE inventory_management_db;
        ```
2.  **Paste the contents of `init_db.sql`:**
    *   Open the `init_db.sql` file located in your project directory with a text editor.
    *   Copy the entire content of the file.
    *   Paste it into the MySQL Command Line Client and press Enter. This will create the necessary tables and schema.

---

## 5. Create a `.env` file

1.  In the root of your project directory, create a new file named `.env`.
2.  Add the following content to the `.env` file. Replace `YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey` and `YourSuperSecretDBPassword` with your actual secret key and the database user's password.

    ```
    SECRET_KEY=YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey
    DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://mysql_username:YourSuperSecretDBPassword@localhost/inventory_management_db
    LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    # Flask configuration
    FLASK_APP=app.py
    FLASK_DEBUG=False
    # Admin user credentials (used by create-admin CLI command)
    ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
    ```

    > **Note:** The `.env` file is used to load environment variables locally. For production deployments, it's recommended to set these variables directly in your hosting environment.

---

## 6. Run Migrations and Create Admin User

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active** and you are in the project's root directory.
2.  **Run Flask migrations** (this will ensure Flask-Migrate is in sync with your database schema, though `init_db.sql` already created the tables):
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db upgrade
    ```
3.  **Create the first admin user:**
    ```bash
    flask create-admin
    ```
    *   You will be prompted to enter a username and password for the admin account.

---

## 7. Run the Application

*   Execute the following command to start the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
*   Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```
*   You can now log in with the admin credentials you created.

# Deployment Guide for PythonAnywhere (Free Plan)

This guide assumes you are starting with a fresh PythonAnywhere account.

---

## 1. Create the Web App

1. From your **PythonAnywhere Dashboard/Home Page**:
   * Navigate to **Web → Add a new web app**.
   * Select **Manual configuration**.
   * Choose **Python 3.13**.
   * This will generate your default site:

     ```
     <username>.pythonanywhere.com
     ```

---

## 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. Open a new **Bash console** from the Dashboard.
2. Create a virtual environment (it will be stored in `~/.virtualenvs/`):

```bash
mkvirtualenv myvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.13
```

> **Note:** `mkvirtualenv` is a PythonAnywhere helper command that creates a virtual environment inside `~/.virtualenvs/` and automatically configures it for use with `workon`.

The resulting path will be:
```
/home/<username>/.virtualenvs/myvirtualenv
```

---

## 3. Clone the Repository

In the Bash console, run:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/stephen-cpe/inventory_management_system.git
cd inventory_management_system
```

---

## 4. Install Dependencies

Ensure your virtual environment is active (it should be by default after creation):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 5. Initialize the Database

1. Go to the **Databases** tab and open a **MySQL console**.
2. Paste the full contents of `init_db.sql` into the console and execute.
   - This creates the initial database schema and tables.

> **Important**: This step must be completed before running Flask migrations, as it sets up the required database structure.

---

## 6. Configure Web App Settings

Go to the **Web** tab and set the following:

* **Source code:**
  ```
  /home/<username>/inventory_management_system
  ```

* **Virtualenv path:**
  ```
  /home/<username>/.virtualenvs/myvirtualenv
  ```

* **WSGI configuration file:**
  ```
  /var/www/<username>_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py
  ```

---

## 7. Edit the WSGI File

Click to edit your WSGI file and replace its contents with:

```python
import os
import sys

# Set environment variables
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'mysql+pymysql://<mysql_username>:YourSuperSecretDBPassword@<username>.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com/<mysql_username>$default'

# Add project directory to Python path
project_home = '/home/<username>/inventory_management_system'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)

# Import the Flask application
from app import app as application
```

> Replace placeholders (`<username>`, `YourSuperSecret...`) with your actual credentials.

---

## 8. Set Environment Variables (Alternative Method)

Instead of hardcoding secrets in the WSGI file, you can use PythonAnywhere's **Environment Variables** section under the **Web** tab:

* `SECRET_KEY=YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey`
* `DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://<mysql_username>:YourSuperSecretDBPassword@<username>.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com/<mysql_username>$default`

If you use this method, remove the `os.environ[...]` lines from the WSGI file.

---

## 9. Run Migrations and Create Admin User

Back in the Bash console, ensure environment variables are set for the session:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL='mysql+pymysql://<mysql_username>:YourSuperSecretDBPassword@<username>.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com/<mysql_username>$default'
export SECRET_KEY='YourSuperSecretVeryLongKey'

cd ~/inventory_management_system

flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade

# Create the admin user
flask create-admin
```

> You’ll be prompted to enter a username and password for the admin account.

---

## 10. Reload the Web App

* Go to the **Web** tab.
* Click **Reload** to apply changes.
* Visit your site:

  ```
  https://<username>.pythonanywhere.com
  ```

---

## 11. Verification Steps

1. Log in using your admin credentials (`/login`).
2. If issues occur:
   * Check the **Error log** in the Web tab.
   * Review `app.log` in the project directory (logging is handled by a `RotatingFileHandler` configured in `app.py`).
